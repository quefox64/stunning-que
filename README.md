 Hi people!
 
 Queneshia here, I love working with computers and trying new things. I love coding and fixing computers far as technical problems.
 I love to travel and help people in need. I am a very caring person no matter who you are.
 I am committed to getting projects started; I don't like to give up on projects I started.
 I love hard work and dedicaton. I'm at a school that pushes me to strive for better even if I feel it's getting tough.
 My teacher taught me well and I hope it pays off at the end.
